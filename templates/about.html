      <p style="width: 70%; margin:auto; margin-top:2%; margin-bottom: 2%">The concept of my application is the communication model of messages - how messages are distorted through the communication process. The user will upload an image to the application, and an image-text model will be used to generate a caption of the image. Then, the caption will be sent to Open AI to generate a story based on the caption. After that, the story will be sent to another text-image model, and another image will be generated based on the story and displayed on the webpage. By juxtaposing two images within the same webpage, people might notice how different the two images changed before and after the “communication” between models. Some details are added to the image while some are lost through the process, mirroring the fact that messages in daily communication are also easy to be distorted.</p>
